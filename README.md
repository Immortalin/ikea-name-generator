# IKEA Name Generator

I created this just for fun, as React practice

Can be seen live at [ikea-name-generator.surge.sh](http://ikea-name-generator.surge.sh/)

## What it does

Click a button and it generates a random string of letters 3 - 10 characters long. After too many consonants it throws a vowel in. Most consonants can't be repeated. Some o's and a's are changed to Swedish characters so you can end up with "Plöfp" and "Yåvra". It's cute and useless. Enjoy!
